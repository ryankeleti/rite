My site-building code (mostly). (r)yan-site? :)

## Warning

The code here is tailored towards my website and my use cases.
It is unlikely that it will be direct solution to general website
construction, at least without significant code modification to
the templates, rendering module, and static & style files.

If you want to use this code, you can edit the `templates` and
`content` directories with your own layout and content, which I
have stripped from this repository. A lot of static files and
resources are hardcoded,so there is some cleanup that could be
achieved in that area.

Please let me know if you do intend to use this code,
as I could make it more palatable for configuration.
