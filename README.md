My site-building code (mostly). (r)yan-site? :)

## Warning

The code here is tailored towards my website and my use cases.
It is unlikely that it will be direct solution to general website
construction, at least without significant code modification
to the templates, rendering module, and static & style files.
If you want to use this code, you'll have to edit the `templates`
directory with your own content, which I have stripped from this
repository. A lot of static files and resources are hardcoded,
so there is some cleanup that could be achieved in that area.
The files/styles I use for my website are different than here.

Please let me know if you do intend to use this code,
as I could make it more palatable for configuration.
